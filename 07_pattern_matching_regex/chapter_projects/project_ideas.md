## Project Ideas:
- Find website URLs that begin with http:// or https://.
- Clean up dates in different date formats (such as 3/14/2019, 03-14-2019, and 2015/3/19) by replacing them with dates in a single, standard format.
- Remove sensitive information such as Social Security or credit card numbers.
- Find common typos such as multiple spaces between words, accidentally accidentally repeated words,
or multiple exclamation marks at the end of sentences.
