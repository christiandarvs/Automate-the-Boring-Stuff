Strong Password Detection:
    ask user for their password and save it on a variable
    create a function that checks whether their password is weak or strong:
        - import the re module
        - create a regex that has 8 =+ characters, contains both uppercase and lowercase, at least 1 digit
        - pass the password to the function
        - use the re.search or re.match
        - return True or False

RegEx of the strip() method:
    ask the user to input a word, phrase, sentence
    create a function that will replicate what the strip() does
        - import the re module
        - if no argument is passed, then remove the whitespace characters at the end and beginning
        - if there's an argument passed, then removed that from the text
